# Cloud Native Observability Platform with Secure IAM

A **cloud-native observability and monitoring platform** designed to demonstrate modern **DevOps, microservices, and security practices**.

The system includes:

* Containerized microservices
* Observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
* Role-Based Access Control (IAM)
* JWT authentication
* Audit logging for security events
* Interactive monitoring dashboard

This project simulates how **enterprise DevOps platforms monitor applications and enforce access control**.

# Running the Platform

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Aadhilrajeeb-oss/Cloud-Native-Observability-Platform.git
```

Navigate into the project

```
cd cloud-observability-platform
```

Start the platform

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

# Access the Platform

| Service    | URL                   |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Dashboard  | http://localhost:8080 |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 |
| Grafana    | http://localhost:3000 |
| Task API   | http://localhost:6060 |
| User API   | http://localhost:5000 |

---

# IAM Roles

| Role      | Permissions    |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Admin     | Full access    |
| Developer | Read access    |
| Viewer    | Dashboard only |

Example credentials:

```
admin / admin123
dev / dev123
viewer / view123
```

---

# Audit Logging

Security events are recorded including:

* login attempts
* user creation
* role changes
* unauthorized API requests

Example audit log:

```
2026-03-15 - admin logged in successfully
2026-03-15 - User analyst created with role viewer
2026-03-15 - Unauthorized task creation attempt by viewer
```

# Future Improvements

* Kubernetes Helm deployment
* GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
* Prometheus alert rules
* Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
* Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)
